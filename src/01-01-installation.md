# Installation

If you're on OSX or Linux, the easiest way to start using Noir and Nargo is via noirup. Just open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/main/install | bash
```

Close the terminal, open another one, and run

```bash
noirup
```

Done, you should have the latest version working. You can check with `nargo --version`.

Nightly versions
To install the nightly version of Noir (updated daily) run:

```bash
noirup -n
```
